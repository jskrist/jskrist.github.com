<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Structures of polymers, metals, and ceramics as the basis for their mechanical behavior. Manipulation of structure through processes such as heat treatment and solidification. Mechanisms of material failure in service (yielding, fracture, fatigue, creep, corrosion, wear) and simple design techniques to avoid these failures.  Strategies for material selection in design.</p>
