<Div class="bodyText">
<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Introduction to fluid mechanics with coverage of theory and applications of incompressible viscous and inviscid flows, and compressible high speed flows.</p>
<p>This description is not nearly enough to convey the amount of work the labs require.  If you are going throught the recommended curriculum for an ME then this will be your first hard lab class in this department, good luck.</p>
