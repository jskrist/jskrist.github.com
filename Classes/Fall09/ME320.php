<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Principles and application of heat transfer by conduction, convection, and thermal radiation.</p>
<p>I should start by mentioning that I dislike heat transfer in general.  This class is a good class, although the labs are way more work than they need to be.  I had an un experienced grad student teach the class and I think my class suffered a little because of it.  She was not unintelligent, she just did not have any experience teaching.</p>
