<Div class="bodyText">
<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Basic electromechanical techniques used in modern instrumentation and control systems. Use of transducers and actuators. Signal conditioning, grounding, and shielding. Analog and digital signal processing and feedback control methods with emphasis on frequency domain techniques. Frequency response of continuous and discrete systems.</p>
<p>This class is interesting and intense.  There is a lot of math, and there is no way to get around it.  The Professor I had always said "you will use every peice of mathematics you have ever learned in this class."  Now, I have learned a lot of math in my life, but he was not kidding, you will use some of the most obscure math that you have ever learned.  The Lab is fun, and does not require much work, but it does have a pre-lab.</p>
