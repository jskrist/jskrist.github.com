<Div class="bodyText">
<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Design and analysis of machinery for loadbearing and power transmission. Consideration of material failure modes, including yielding, fracture, fatigue and creep. Design and selection of machine elements: bolts, springs, rolling element bearings, fluid film lubrication, and power transmissions, including gears and friction drives.</p>
<p>This is a nice practical class that forces its students to work in a group on everything.  I don't mean that in a negative way.  You will be paired into a group for the entire semester and do homework and projects together.  it is fun and the projects you get to work on can be interesting.  See this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgTUye-3tKY" target="_blank">video</a> for an example of the final project the semester I took the class, keep an eye out for a copper spiral!</p>
