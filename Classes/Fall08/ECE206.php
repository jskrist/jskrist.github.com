<p class="titleText">ECE 206 - Electric and Electronic Circuits Lab</p></Div>
<Div class="bodyText">
<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Laboratory instruments and basic measurement techniques, electric circuits, CMOS logic circuits, DTL and TTL circuits, and op-amps. Credit is not given to Computer or Electrical Engineering majors. Prerequisite: PHYS 212; concurrent registration in ECE 205.</p>
<p>This Lab is pretty simple if you have ever worked on any electronics before.  If not, then there will be some reading to do.  I lucked out and had one of the worst TAs I have ever had in my life.  Be prepared to have a rough semester if your TA doesn't know that Hz=1/s.</p>
