<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers, both consumers and producers, within the larger economic system. Primary emphasis on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in prompting efficiency in the economy.</p>
<p>This class has an excellent book, and Although I will put what notes I have from this class I strongly suggest getting a hold of a copy of the book.  I will post the book information soon.</p>
