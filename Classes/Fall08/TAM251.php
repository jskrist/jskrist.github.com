<Div class="bodyText">
<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Relationship between internal stresses and deformations produced by external forces acting on deformable bodies, and design principles based on mechanics of solids: normal stresses, shear stresses, and deformations produced by tensile, compressive, torsional, and bending loading of members; beam deflections; elastic energy and impact; multi-dimensional stress states; buckling of columns.</p>
<p>While I don't disagree with their description I have my notes posted below in chronological order with a short list of topics covered in each class to present my view of the material covered.  These notes are meant to supplement other methods of learning this material and are not meant as a substitute for a good textbook or teacher.  There are some class periods that have no notes, and others in which I did not write down all examples used in class.</p>
