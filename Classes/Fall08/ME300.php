<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Introduction to classical thermodynamics through the second law; system and control-volume analyses of thermodynamic processes; irreversibility and availability; relations for ideal gas mixtures.</p>
<p>This description is not nearly descriptive enough.  This class is fairly complex and although there are many useful notes online from the professor I am not yet allowed to host his notes on this website, although I might suggest looking on the MechSE website for this class.</p>
