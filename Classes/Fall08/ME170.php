<Div class="bodyText">
<p>The University of Illinois describes this class as:</p>
<p>Geometry and topology of engineered components: creation of engineering models and their presentation in standard 2D blueprint form and as 3D wire-frame and shaded solids; meshed topologies for engineering analysis and tool-path generation for component manufacture; ISO and ANSI standards for coordinate dimensioning and tolerancing, with an introduction to geometric dimensioning and tolerancing. Use of ProEngineer 3D solid-modeling software for creating associative models at the component and assembly levels with automatic blueprint creation, interference checking, and linked bill of materials.</p>
<p>I do not have any written notes from this class due to the lack of a necessity.  This class is a lot of fun, and on this page I will have links to my finished parts and models, which have been drawn in Pro-Engineer 3.0 wildfire.  The files currently have a .prt extension but I can save them as many other file types in Pro-E.  There will eventually be a comments page where you can send me a comment about my site and I will do my best to update the site with your suggestions in mind.  When that page in ready you can use it to let me know in what file extension you would like my models.  I will try to have an image and a short description of each part.</p>
<p>These Parts are mine, and although Some of them came from a book, several of them are my own ideas and they are all copyrighted.  If you would like to use my models for anything other than personal education, you must e-mail me and request it.</p>
