				<p>I plan to host the notes I take in my classes at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on this cite. Each week I will be converting my note into a pdf using LaTex and then posting them here.</p>
				<p>I have been quite busy this Semester and although I have been able to convert some of my notes in what little spare time I have I have not had a chance to upload them here, but have no fear I am currently updating the back bone of my cite making it easier for me to update, and faster for you to view it.  Soon I will be posting my content!</p>
				<p>Update: I have recently started a robotics company!  Please check us out at <a href="http://www.rjandk.com" target="blank">rjandk.com</a>.</p>
